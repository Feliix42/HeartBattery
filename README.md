# ❤️Battery

### This app is still very WIP and does not function as intended yet ;)

Having your battery state display as a battery icon or as n% is boring. Spread some love and video game nostalgia and go with ❤️❤️❤️s instead!

This app runs on OS X 10.10+. Use something like [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com) to reorder all your menubar items and optionally hide the system battery state as well. 

Icon is [OS X App Icon Template](http://appicontemplate.com) + [8-Bit Heart Icon](http://kononenkoyaroslav.deviantart.com/art/8-bit-Heart-icon-144007744) from kononenkoyaroslav.
