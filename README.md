### This app is still very WIP and does not quite function as intended yet ;)

Having your battery state display as a battery icon or as n% is boring. Spread some love and video game nostalgia and go with ❤️❤️❤️s instead!

Cheap screenshot (because not having one stinks):

This app runs on OS X 10.10+. Use something like [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com) to reorder all your menubar items and optionally hide the system battery state as well.
